* If the texture/block of your assets does not exist, feel free to create a new entry
* Make a separate pull request for each of the assets
* Use the following format `[Title](link_to_assets)`
* If you are sharing a multiple assets of same entities, use the following format:
    ```
        * Title
            * [Part 1](patch_to_part_1)
            * [Part 2](patch_to_part_2)
    ```
